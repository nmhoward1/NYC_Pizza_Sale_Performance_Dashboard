## Key Findings
	- Customers average 2.32 pizzas per order, showing multi-item purchasing behavior.
	- Fridays drive peak demand with ~8.2K pizzas sold and ~3.5K orders placed.
	- Summer months (May–July) show the strongest seasonal order volumes.
	- November achieved the highest MoM growth (+17.68%), signaling a strong promotional or seasonal impact.
	- Veggie pizzas contribute 23.86% of revenue, but many vegetarian SKUs underperform → excess variety may be inflating costs.


## Business Suggestion Strategies 
	- Optimize product mix: Reduce low-performing vegetarian SKUs to cut costs without impacting revenue.
	- Leverage peak periods: Target promotions and upsell strategies around Fridays and summer months.
	- Investigate November growth drivers: Double down on successful campaigns or seasonal promotions.
	- Enhance customer insights: Segment by repeat vs. new buyers to refine targeting.
	- Forecast demand: Build predictive models for seasonal sales planning and inventory optimization
